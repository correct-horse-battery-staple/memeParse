failed to qualify, practically Pennsylvanian
selling the Yazoo land bordering the Mississipi n'
getting Paleozoic with this
divisions of the Carboniferous

picking up the tempo, from allegro to andante
raising up the stakes, man I'm upping the ante

If you say I'm lying then I might as well double down
call me Janus, I'm two-faced producing double the sound
my rhymings in double time, two over two equals one
I'm the fastest at comp math, buzzing before the clues are done

I'm spinning, albumin, blood that I'm thinning
call me Vitamin K cause I'm the king of warfarin
centrifuges be turning, my accent be slurrin'
but no worse than if a humanities player said 4-hydroxycoumarin

South Cali stronger than it ever was before,
say our heyday / was a mistake, now you proven wrong
Bell is nothing, fight me Davis, you ain't getting no powers

mining tungsten and indium, because all I do is win

gotta punctuate the period / of the actinide series n'


Looking at a stalag/c, can't tell -tite from -mite
It'd be prudent to hang tight, or it just might
be the the moment that you can tell left from right
blindness from sight, dark from light, black from white

Release my new album, sell 10 thousand thousand,
triple double platinum with nobody helpin' him
call it the Life of Pablo Diego Jose Francisco
de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Maria de los Remedios
Cipriano de la Santisma Trinidad Ruiz
y Picasso

supernova type II, population III,
hotter than a B, peaking in ranges of B-V
record metallicity

take it up before HQ,
they say the rap game is hard
that'll you'll never be a star
what you see is what you get and what you get is what you are

Hayashi track
almanac
on the attack

methanogenesis
nucleosynthesis
neutrino capture reverse URCA processes
heat past a class M 15 solar masses
expansion can't ignore it
branch is called asymptotic

I'm past the Pleiades
faster than Hades
I out run the god of death
I'm living immortal
til 4004 though
I'll finally catch up my breath

caught in an Ekman spiral, waiting for the friction
ain't no time for mourning I forbid valediction

hooked on caffiene, perform like a master
methamphetamine, addict needs a sponsor
work at Rheims, get yourself a tonsure

the Texan iron alley, call me austenite
hydroxyfluoroapatite

making it from Amherst to NYC,
living the American dream

now I'm spitting hot fire like an incandescent ball of gas
but it's not too far in the past
inverse square, heat falling fast
put two bodies together just trying to calm our nerves and
confer to maintain our failing bonus conversion
trying to get a buzz, itching, hear and clue and buzz, twitching
with little but the LRL vector staying consistent
money getting tight we could use a Laval nozzle
to turn sound to speed something like that would cause of all of our problems to fade away, any day, it'd help us pay
for the nationals tournaments, hopes that seem so far away

never clean, since the young age of seventeen
drinking mountain dew at tourneys to get high off the caffeine

living in Andersonville with the Judge looming over me
weighting heavy, immovable obstrate obstacle for e

the other teams bonus being on your speciatly
failing to qualify by D-score to ICT
negging binary trees with minimum spanning trees
'cause your knowledge's all fake and you don't know what those words mean

but never forget that quiz bowl is only what you make of it
and only you can decide just what it is you take from it
so whether that be books or trophies or even just friends
never let it be said that it's not worth it in the end

that tossups dead
the bonus going unread
prolly 'cause both teams are bad

my tempo is part of me
my hyrics are heavenly
both will creschend in the final act
tickets a buck apiece
all amherst no DC
I'm am a hot ball of gas
spit fire just like a sun

feud between classics
and quantum mechanics
the CH74 was run
when Alain Aspect was
finished and he cried
emphatically sighed
"quantum entangle

[A, B, O, Duffy and the British X-factor]

--------------------------------------
2 to the 1 to the 1, to the three,
Yo I'm back, spitting fire like Wolf-Rayet type 3,
Shedding gas like its fashionable, 


Yo I'm back, spitting fire like a hot ball of gas
inverse square law based on distance, heat is picking fast
put together two masses, low metallicity
I'm the youngest amoung us 'cause I'm population III

I'm spinning, albumin, blood that I'm thinning
call me vitamin K 'cause I'm the king of warfarin
it's thicker than liquor, it's man's answer to ichor
distilled stock clues, alphabet soup mixture

Contemplate why Burton was built on Trent
Housman on Milton to explain man's descent
Maryland Periplus, chart the Ann Arbor harbor
doubt my mayorness? buy my wife and daughter [dar-ter]

Sucks when the other team gets the bonus on your specialty
or when your D-score is too low to qualify for ICT
or when you neg binary tree with minimum spanning tree
'cause you have fake knowledge and you thought you heard Fibonacci

Say I'm lying, double down, I ain't got nothing to lose
Call me Janus, two-faced, pumping double the tunes
rhyming double-time, 'cause I'm gonna triple my treble
raising up the roof, like I'm up on another level

I am counting like Stevens, going one two three blackbird
killing flocks, 13 different ways of looking at murder
Through imperial ways, declare no sundaes for days,
death of an ice cream salesman, no more order at keys.

I'm beginning with Saint-Saens and ending in swan song
Just like Lemminkainen I be using my comb wrong
blood on the teeth, you best not messin' with me
or you'll need to use the Sampo, put you back in one piece

tungsten plus indium yields W-I-N
"the deluge hypothesis is about the Euxian basin"
so quoth the sea raven, searching out far and wide
resting on a bust of Grotius and yelling about the tide

You callin' us sea 'nenomes but bruh we ain't enemies
I'm caviar tapenade, you assorted fruit jellies
you streets behind me and I'm blockchains ahead
take a nappe in your thrust sheet and go straight back to bed

master-slave flip-flop, is that comp sci or Hegel
I declarin' this hip-hop, you can call that a label
Tossups going dead, bonuses are unread
pretty sure I know the reason: it's that both teams are bad.

but never forget - quiz bowl's only what you make of it
and only you can decide just what it is you take from it
so whether that be books or trophies or even friends
never let it be said that it's not worth it in the end
