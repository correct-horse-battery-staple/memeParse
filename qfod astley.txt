Here's a fun themed puzzle, primarily focused around literature:

1.	The title of this work comes from a song on the cassette _Songs After Dark_, which is lost by Kathy during her time at Hailsham. When Tommy returns it to her, he shares his theory that the paintings they created in their time there were to detect love - however, Mistress reveals that they were meant to show Hailsham was a more humane option for its students.

2.	This work is a continuation of the author's earlier autobiographic _Boy_ which focused on his adulthood. The author worked for Shell Oil in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania before fighting in the Greek front of WWII as a fighter pilot. Other works by this author include _Esio Trot_ and _The Witches_.

3.	The second section of this work spans ten years in which Mrs. Ramsay and two of her eight children die. After that Time Passes section, the Ramsays return to the Isle of Skye and finally visit the title location, where Lily Briscoe completes the painting she had envisioned since their first visit to the Hebrides.

4.	The title of the work refers to the previous Receiver of Memory, whose first memory to be received is a vision of a sled ride down a snowy hill. This confuses the young Jonas, who has never seen snow, a sled, or a hill, a consequence of the Community's adoption of Sameness.

5.	This character attempts to read a book called _If on a winter's night a traveler_ in the Italo Calvino work of the same name. This character learns that the titles of each chapter spell out a sentence, which questions what happens if, on a winter's night a traveler looks down in the gathering shadow.

Taking the first word of each answer yields a phrase - what word is missing from it?
